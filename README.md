# Sequelize_orm_nodjs_postgres

Sequelize is a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js that allows you to interact with relational databases using a higher level of abstraction. With Sequelize, you can easily define database models, perform CRUD operations, and execute complex queries using JavaScript instead of raw SQL.

In this activity, the main thing that I do is to focus how can I get familiar with Sequelize to build robust backend application with Node Js and try to use cli to run commands.
